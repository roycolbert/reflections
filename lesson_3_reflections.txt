When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to work with others and also have a backup of your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you have a remote repository you may be working with others and code pushed there my not be ready for consumption.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I would use a fork when I could not edit or did not want to change a repository. I would clone a repository if I had intentions to make make changes to the code in the repository. I would use a branch as a way to experiment with the code with the intention of merging back into the master.
